            "intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\r\n",

            "allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\r\n",
            "might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\r\n",

            "chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\r\n",
            "now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\r\n",
